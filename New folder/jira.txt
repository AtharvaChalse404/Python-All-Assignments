Navigate to the Project and Issue: Select the project where the task belongs. Then, navigate to the specific issue or task you want to assign.

Open the Issue: Click on the issue to open it and view its details.

Find the Assignee Field: Look for the "Assignee" field. It's usually located near the top of the issue details page.

Click on the Assignee Field: Click on the Assignee field to open the dropdown menu.

Select the Assignee: From the dropdown menu, select the name of the person you want to assign the task to. This will assign the task to that person.

Save Changes: After selecting the assignee, save the changes you made to the issue.

The specific steps might vary slightly depending on the version of Jira you're using and any customizations your organization has made to its Jira instance.
