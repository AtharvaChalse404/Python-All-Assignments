Setting up PyTest involves several steps to install PyTest and organize your test files properly. PyTest is a testing framework for Python that makes it easy to write simple and scalable tests. Here's how you can set it up:

Install PyTest:

You can install PyTest using pip, Python's package manager:

 code
pip install pytest
Organize Your Test Files:

By convention, PyTest looks for test files that start with test_ or end with _test.py. It searches for tests within the current directory and its subdirectories. You can organize your tests within your project structure.

Write Your Tests:

Write your test functions using PyTest's conventions. Test functions should start with test_ and can use PyTest's assert methods to make assertions about the behavior of your code.

Here's an example of a simple test function in a test file named test_example.py:

python
 code
# test_example.py
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

def test_addition():
    assert add(3, 5) == 8
Run Your Tests:

You can run your tests using the pytest command in your terminal. PyTest will automatically discover and run your test functions.

 code
pytest
You can also specify the directory or specific files to test:


pytest tests/
pytest test_example.py
View Test Results:

PyTest provides detailed output about the tests it runs, including information about passing and failing tests, assertions, and coverage.

Use PyTest Features:

PyTest comes with many features and plugins to enhance your testing experience. You can use fixtures, parameterized tests, marks, and plugins to extend PyTest's functionality according to your testing needs.

That's it! You've now set up PyTest and can start writing and running tests for your Python code. PyTest's simplicity and flexibility make it a popular choice for testing Python applications of all sizes.
