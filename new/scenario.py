# To implement the scenario you described in Django, we need to define models for Client and Project, set up relationships between them, create views and templates to handle CRUD operations, and manage project assignments to users. Here's a step-by-step guide:

# Define Models: Define models for Client and Project in models.py of the appropriate app:
# python

# # models.py

# from django.db import models
# from django.contrib.auth.models import User

# class Client(models.Model):
#     name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
#     # Add other client-related fields as needed

#     def __str__(self):
#         return self.name

# class Project(models.Model):
#     name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
#     client = models.ForeignKey(Client, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
#     users = models.ManyToManyField(User)
#     # Add other project-related fields as needed

#     def __str__(self):
#         return self.name
# Register Models in Admin: Register the Client and Project models in the admin panel in admin.py:
# python

# # admin.py

# from django.contrib import admin
# from .models import Client, Project

# admin.site.register(Client)
# admin.site.register(Project)
# Create Views and Templates: Create views and templates to handle CRUD operations for clients and projects, and manage project assignments to users.

# Retrieve Assigned Projects to Logged-In Users: To retrieve assigned projects to logged-in users, you can use Django's authentication system and queryset filtering to display projects assigned to the currently logged-in user.

# Here's a basic example of how you might implement these views:

# python

# # views.py

# from django.shortcuts import render, redirect
# from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required
# from .models import Client, Project

# @login_required
# def client_list(request):
#     clients = Client.objects.all()
#     return render(request, 'client_list.html', {'clients': clients})

# @login_required
# def client_detail(request, client_id):
#     client = Client.objects.get(id=client_id)
#     return render(request, 'client_detail.html', {'client': client})

# @login_required
# def project_detail(request, project_id):
#     project = Project.objects.get(id=project_id)
#     return render(request, 'project_detail.html', {'project': project})

# # Other views for editing, deleting clients and projects, and assigning users to projects
# Retrieve Assigned Projects to Logged-In Users: You can retrieve assigned projects to logged-in users by filtering the projects based on the currently logged-in user:
# python

# @login_required
# def user_projects(request):
#     user_projects = Project.objects.filter(users=request.user)
#     return render(request, 'user_projects.html', {'user_projects': user_projects})
